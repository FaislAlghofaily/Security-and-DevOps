# Security-and-DevOps
This is my 4th and final project in my udacity java web Devoleper Nanodegree journey.

here i was able to secure my web service using JWT and automatically make authentication token , and getting that token from the headers of the response and adding it to the next header request after logging in.
i made sure that in the junit testing that the code coverage is more than %80.
started logging the application using logback and SLF4j and made the logging to external log file then added it to Splunk and indexed.
used AWS amazon linux server to build my application in Jenkins docker.

technologies used:
JWT,
SLF4J,
logback,
Splunk,
AWS,
Jenkins,
Docker.
